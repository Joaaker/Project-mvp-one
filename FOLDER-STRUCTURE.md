# Project Folder Structure Guide

A guide to understanding the frontend folder structure. This project follows a page-based, separation-of-concerns approach to keep the codebase clean, scalable, and easy for developers to navigate.

***

## üß± `src/components`

This directory holds all of your reusable UI pieces. The key is how it's subdivided:

* **`src/components/[ComponentName]/` (Feature Components)**
    This pattern is for creating larger, "smart" components that are tied to a specific feature. Each component lives in its own folder, keeping its logic and related files **self-contained**.
  * **Example**: `src/components/LoginCard/` would contain:
    * `LoginCard.tsx`: The main component logic that assembles smaller UI pieces.
    * **(Optional)** `LoginCard.css`: For styles that *only* apply to the `LoginCard`. This approach, known as co-location, is great for keeping component-specific styles isolated.
  * **Alternative Styling**: Instead of co-locating styles, you can manage them in a central `src/css` directory. You can then import all necessary stylesheets into a single entry point like `src/index.css`, which is then imported just once into your main application file (e.g., `main.tsx`).

* **`src/components/ui/` (UI Primitives)**
    This folder is for your generic, highly reusable, "dumb" components, which are often provided by a library like **shadcn/ui**. Think of these as your basic building blocks (your LEGOs). They are purely **presentational** and receive all their data and functions via props.
  * **Example**:
    * `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
    * `src/components/ui/Card.tsx`

***

## üìÑ `src/pages`

This folder contains components that represent an entire page or view in your application, corresponding to a specific URL route. Pages are responsible for **fetching data** and **composing layouts and components** to build the final user interface.

* **Example**:
  * `src/pages/Login.tsx` (Renders at the `/login` route)
  * `src/pages/FormRegistration.tsx` (Renders at the `/register` route)

***

## üèóÔ∏è `src/layouts`

Layout components define the common structure or "shell" for your pages, such as a header, footer, or sidebar. This prevents you from having to repeat the same structure on every single page. They typically wrap the page content.

* **Example**:
  * `src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` (Includes a navbar and footer for public-facing pages)
  * `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx` (Includes a sidebar for authenticated users)

***

## üåê `src/contexts`

This is where you manage global state using React's Context API. It's perfect for data that needs to be accessible by many components at different levels of the component tree, without having to pass props down manually (a problem known as "**prop drilling**").

* **Example**:
  * `AuthContext.tsx` (To provide user data and authentication status throughout the app)
  * `ThemeContext.tsx` (To manage light/dark mode)

***

## üé£ `src/hooks`

This folder is for your custom React Hooks. Hooks allow you to extract and reuse **stateful logic** from a component. If you find yourself writing the same logic (like fetching data or handling form state) in multiple components, it's a good candidate for a custom hook.

* **Example**:
  * `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (A hook that simplifies accessing the `AuthContext`)
  * `src/hooks/useFetch.ts` (A hook to handle data fetching, loading, and error states)

***

## üõ†Ô∏è `src/lib`

This is your general-purpose "toolbox" for utility functions and other helper code that isn't a React component, hook, or context. It's for pure, reusable logic that can be used anywhere.

* **Example**:
  * `src/lib/utils.ts` (Can contain functions like `formatDate()` or the `cn` utility for combining Tailwind classes)
  * `src/lib/api.ts` (For configuring an API client like Axios)
